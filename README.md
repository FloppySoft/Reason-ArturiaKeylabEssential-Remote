# Reason-ArturiaKeylabEssential-Remote

Remote is the Propellerheadʼs protocol for communication between hardware control surfaces and Reason Studio application. This project provides Reason remote script for the **DAW Command Center** surface of the Arturia Keylab Essential keyboard

**Note**: I am not affiliated or associated in any way with Arturia or Propellerhead. I have created these files myself with the files and programs legally available to me.

:warning: **WARNING**: You download and use these files entirely at your own risk!
