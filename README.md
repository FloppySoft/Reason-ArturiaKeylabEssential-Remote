# Reason-ArturiaKeylabEssential-Remote

Remote is the Propellerheadʼs protocol for communication between hardware control surfaces and Reason Studio application. This project provides Reason remote scripts for the **DAW Command Center** surface of the Arturia Keylab Essential keyboard

**Note**: I am not affiliated or associated in any way with Arturia or Propellerhead. I have created these files myself with the files and programs legally available to me.

:warning: **WARNING**: You download and use these files entirely at your own risk!

## History

* [Changelog](./CHANGELOG.md)

## Know bugs

* When Preset is selected, jog-wheel didn't change the preset selection (on ID8, Combinator)
  * Workaround on Combinator has been to use `Select Patch Delta` remotable item and jog-wheel as delta control for now.
* Part1/Part2/Live buttons didn't select group variations on map file
  * workarround has been to use Keyboard Shortcut Variations for now.
